**Channel** class
*****************

A channel is a system that takes as input a secret x, whose possible values 
come from a finite set X , and whose only observable behavior is to produce an 
output y, whose possible values come from a finite set Y.

A Channel object has three attributes:

* matrix: A channel matrix from X to Y whose rows give the distribution on 
  outputs corresponding to each possible input. That is, entry matrix[x][y] denotes 
  p(y|x), the conditional probability of getting output y given input x. Note that 
  all entries in a channel matrix are between 0 and 1, and each row sums to 1.
* prior: A Distribution object, which represents the prior probability 
  distribution on the set of secrets.
* num_out: The number of outputs in the channel. It is exactly the number of 
  columns in matrix.

.. warning:: To create a Channel object you need first to create a Distribution 
             object, to keep the prior distribution on the set of secrets.
