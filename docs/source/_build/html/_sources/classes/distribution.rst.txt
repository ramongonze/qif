**Distribution** class
**********************

It represents a probability distribution on a set of elements.

A Distribution object has two attributes:

* num_el: The number of elements in the set.
* prob: A vector containing the probability of each element from the set.

The vector prob is valid when all the elements are in the interval [0,1] 
and the sum of all numbers in the vector is 1, with margin of error 
(upper or lower) equals to a constant epsilon, by default set as 10e-6.
