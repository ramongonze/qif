Vulnerability
*************

.. _bayes-vulnerability:

.. cpp:function:: long double bayesVulnerability(Distribution& prior)
    
    Prior Bayes vulnerability. It is the probability of an adversary guessing a 
    secret correctly in one try.

    :param prior: Prior distribution on the set of secrets.
    
    :return: Bayes vulnerability of a prior distribution.

.. cpp:function:: long double bayesVulnerability(Hyper& hyper)

    Posterior Bayes vulnerability. It is the expected probability of an adversary 
    guessing a secret correctly in one try. It is calculated weighting the Bayes 
    vulnerability of each posterior by its probability of occuring.

    :param hyper: A hyper-distribution.

    :return: Bayes vulnerability of a hyper-distribution.

.. _g-vulnerability:

.. cpp:function:: long double gVulnerability(Gain& gain)

    Prior g-vulnerability. It is a function that measures how vulnerable a secret 
    is. This value corresponds to the expected gain of an adversary guessing the 
    secret correctly, given a set of actions that she/he can take.

    :param gain: A gain function.

    :return: g-vulnerability of a prior distribution.

.. cpp:function:: long double gVulnerability(Hyper& hyper, Gain& gain)

    Posterior g-vulnerability. It is the expected gain of the adversary over the 
    inner distributions.

    :param hyper: A hyper-distribution.

    :param gain: A gain function for a set of secrets.

    :return: g-vulnerability of a hyper-distribution.

.. _k-tries:

.. cpp:function:: long double kTries(Distribution& prior, int k)

    Prior k-tries. It is the probability of the adversary guess the value of the 
    secret correctly in k tries, looking into a prior distribution.

    :param prior: Prior distribution on the set of secrets.

    :param k: Number of tries the adversary has to guess the secret.

    :return: A probability.

.. cpp:function:: long double kTries(Hyper& hyper, int k)

    :param hyper: A hyper-distribution.

    :param k: Number of tries the adversary has to guess the secret.

    :return: The probability of an adversary guessing
        the secret correctly in k tries, looking into a hyper-distribution.
