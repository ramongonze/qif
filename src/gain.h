/**
 * \brief Gain functions.
 *
 * Definition of a gain function:
 * 
 * Given a finite, non-empty set **X** (of possible secret values) and a non-empty set
 * **W** (of possible actions), a gain function is a function _g_: **W** x **X** â†’ R.
 * The idea is that _g(w, x)_ specifies the gain that the adversary achieves by taking
 * action _w_ when the actual value of the secret is _x_.
 * 
 * A @ref Gain object has 3 attributes:
 *
 * - @ref prior : A @ref Distribution object, which represents
 * the prior probability distribution on the set of secrets.
 *
 * - @ref matrix : A matrix \c w x \c n where \c w is the number of actions that 
 * the adversary can take and \c n is the number of secrets.
 *
 * - @ref num_act : Number of distinct actions that an adversary can take.
 *
